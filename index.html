            She applies to 20 jobs a day on Indeed and they either don't
            respond, you get an interview but not a call back, or donâ€™t pay well

            Mayowa has four children that all attend a private school that she
            pays by semester to keep them in. They have expensive after school
            activities that need monthly payments.

            Her children are picky eaters so groceries tend to be very
            expensive. She works from home as her husband buys the groceries.
            Downside is that he does not know how to budget, and he uses her
            money and not his own.

            Although Mayowa is a great and reliable worker, she works crazy
            hours and barely has time to spend with her family. Her children
            miss her.

            Mayowa wants to cut her hours so she can spend more time with her
            family, but this may affect her pay and her position in the company.
